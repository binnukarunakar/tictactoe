# tictactoe
 This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 board, where two players take turns marking their respective symbols ('X' and 'O') on the board. The game continues until one player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols, or until the board is full resulting in a tie.

Features:

The game is played in the console/terminal.
Players take turns making moves by entering the position (1-9) where they want to place their symbol.
The game checks for a winner after each move and ends when a player wins or when the board is full (tie).
The winner (if any) is announced at the end of the game.
Usage:
To play the game, simply run the Python script provided in the repository. Follow the instructions to make your moves and enjoy the classic Tic Tac Toe experience.

This project serves as a fun and educational exercise for beginners to practice Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and lists. Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon the code to customize the game or add additional features.
