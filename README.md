# tictactoe
 This repository features a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Played on a 3x3 board, two players take turns marking 'X' and 'O'. Victory is achieved by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The game ends in a tie if the board fills up. Enjoy the timeless challenge!
